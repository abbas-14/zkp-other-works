# Build Script

> WARNING: This may not generate a reproducible ELF which is necessary for verifying that your binary corresponds to given source code.

If you want your program crate to be built automatically whenever you build/run your script crate, you can add a `build.rs` file inside of `script/` (at the same level as `Cargo.toml`):

```rust,noplayground
{{#include ../../examples/fibonacci/script/build.rs}}
```

Make sure to also add `sp1-helper` as a build dependency in `script/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[build-dependencies]
sp1-helper = "1.0.1"
```

If you run `RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -vv`, you will see the following output from the build script if the program has changed, indicating that the program was rebuilt:

````
